# CursoCSharp Project

## Project Overview

This project, named **CursoCSharp**, was developed as a learning exercise to consolidate C# knowledge through various practical examples. It covers fundamental and advanced topics such as classes, methods, collections, object-oriented programming (OOP), exceptions, and even basic API usage. The project offers a centralized system to execute a wide range of C# exercises, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Features

The project covers a wide variety of C# topics, including:

- **Classes and Methods**: Explore methods with return types, static methods, attributes, parameters, enums, structs, and more.
- **Collections**: Work with arrays, lists, sets, queues, stacks, dictionaries, and other common collection types in C#.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Delve into OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces.
- **Methods and Functions**: Understand how to use lambda expressions, delegates, anonymous functions, and method extensions.
- **Exception Handling**: Learn how to handle exceptions and create custom exception classes.
- **Basic API Usage**: Practice basic file operations and API usage in C#.

## Key Classes and Exercises

Here are some of the notable exercises implemented:

### Classes and Methods:
- `MetodosComRetorno.Executar`: Demonstrates methods with return types.
- `AtributosEstaticos.Executar`: Learn about static attributes in C#.
- `Enum.ExemploEnum.Executar`: Explore enum usage.
- `StructVsClasse.Executar`: Compare structs versus classes.

### Collections:
- `Array.Executar`: Work with arrays.
- `ColecoesList.Executar`: Demonstrates list collections.
- `Dictionary.Executar`: Explore the dictionary collection type.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- `Heranca.Executar`: Shows how inheritance works in C#.
- `Encapsulamento.Executar`: Explore encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
- `Polimorfismo.Executar`: Demonstrates polymorphism.

### Exception Handling:
- `PrimeiraExcecao.Executar`: Handle the first exception.
- `ExcecoesPersonalizadas.Executar`: Implement custom exceptions.

### API Usage:
- `PrimeiroArquivo.Executar`: Demonstrates basic file manipulation through the API.

## Project Structure

The project organizes exercises by category, providing a centralized way to access and execute each one:

- **ClassesEMetodos**: Exercises related to C# classes and methods.
- **Colecoes**: Exercises focused on collections in C#.
- **OO**: Covers object-oriented programming concepts.
- **MetodosEFuncoes**: Demonstrates lambda expressions and delegate usage.
- **Excecoes**: Focuses on exception handling in C#.
- **API**: Includes examples for working with basic APIs.
